### README for Controller Script (`controller.py`)

#### Purpose
The `controller.py` script serves as a master controller for a series of data processing steps. It orchestrates the workflow by sequentially running `csv_merge.py`, `data_filter.py`, and `profile_verdict.py`, automating the entire process of merging, filtering, and reviewing CSV data.

#### How It Works

##### Process Overview
1. **CSV Merging:**
   - The script starts by executing `csv_merge.py`, which merges multiple CSV and Excel files from a specified folder into a single CSV file. This file includes an added 'Verdict' column for further processing.
   - The output is a merged CSV file named with the current date.

2. **Data Filtering:**
   - Next, `data_filter.py` is triggered. This script takes the recently merged CSV file and applies specified filters and exclusion criteria.
   - The script overwrites the original merged file with the filtered data.

3. **Profile Verdict:**
   - Finally, `profile_verdict.py` is executed. This script allows for an interactive review of the profiles in the filtered CSV file, where a user can input a verdict for each profile.
   - The process can involve user interaction for verdict entry and can save progress during the review.

##### Running the Script
- Simply run `controller.py` using a Python interpreter.
- No additional arguments or manual steps are needed. The script manages the execution of all processing stages.

##### Prerequisites
- Ensure that `python` or `python3` is correctly set up and accessible from your command line.
- Place `controller.py` in the same directory as `csv_merge.py`, `data_filter.py`, and `profile_verdict.py`.
- The directory should also contain a `CSV_files` folder for `csv_merge.py` and a `keywords.csv` file for `data_filter.py`.

#### Output
- A single CSV file that has been merged, filtered, and is ready for review through `profile_verdict.py`.
- Intermediate outputs and summaries from each script are displayed in the console.

#### Notes for Future Development
- Enhancements could include error handling improvements, support for configurable paths, and integration with additional data processing or analysis scripts.
