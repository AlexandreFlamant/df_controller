Certainly! Here's the updated README for the modified `csv_merge.py` script, including the addition of the 'Verdict' column:

### README for CSV Merge Tool (`csv_merge.py`)

#### Purpose
The `csv_merge.py` script is designed to merge multiple CSV and Excel files into a single CSV file. It is ideal for consolidating data from various sources with identical column structures into a unified format. The script now also adds a 'Verdict' column to accommodate subsequent processing steps.

#### How It Works

##### Process Overview
- The script scans a specified folder (`CSV_files`) for all CSV and Excel files.
- It merges these files into a single DataFrame, assuming they all share the same column structure.
- A new 'Verdict' column is added to the merged DataFrame to facilitate further data processing, particularly for scripts that require this column.
- The merged data, along with the new 'Verdict' column, is saved into a new CSV file, named with the current date.

##### Running the Script
- Run the script using a Python interpreter. No additional arguments are needed.
- Ensure the `CSV_files` folder exists in the same directory as the script and contains the files to be merged.
- The script outputs a merged CSV file in the script's directory, complete with a summary of the merging process.

##### Output
- The output file is named `merged_data_<current_date>.csv`.
- It contains all data from the merged CSV and Excel files, along with an empty 'Verdict' column.
- The script also outputs the total number of CSV and Excel files merged and the total number of rows in the final merged document.

#### Notes for Future Development
- Future enhancements could include adding support for merging files with slightly different column structures, improving error handling, and implementing a user interface for selecting specific files or specifying merge criteria.
