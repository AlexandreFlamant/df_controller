### README for Profile Verdict Script

#### Overview
The `profile_verdict.py` script is designed to facilitate the review process of profiles contained in a CSV file. This tool is particularly useful for quickly and efficiently evaluating and annotating a large number of profiles, ideal for tasks like filtering potential leads or contacts.

#### Key Features
- **Automated File Selection:** Automatically selects the most recently modified CSV file in the current directory for review.
- **Progress Tracking:** Displays the review progress, showing how many profiles have been reviewed out of the total.
- **Interactive Review Process:** Allows users to input their verdict ('Y' or 'N') for each profile, along with options to save progress or exit the review session.
- **Data Preservation:** Offers the option to save the current progress or exit without saving.
- **Automatic Saving Upon Completion:** Automatically saves the data when all profiles have been reviewed.

#### How It Works
1. **Finding the Latest File:** 
   - The script starts by finding the latest CSV file in the current directory, assuming the naming pattern 'merged_data_*.csv'.

2. **Reviewing Profiles:**
   - Profiles are presented one by one to the user.
   - Each profile displays key information such as name, location, new role, company tagline, serial founder status, past positions, and education.

3. **Inputting Verdict:**
   - For each profile, the user inputs a verdict ('Y' or 'N').
   - The user can also input 'SAVE' to save the current progress and exit, or 'EXIT' to exit without saving.

4. **Progress Display:**
   - After each verdict, the script updates and displays the review progress.

5. **Completion and Auto-Save:**
   - Upon reviewing all profiles, the script automatically saves the data and notifies the user that the review process is complete.

#### Running the Script
- Run the script using a Python interpreter.
- No additional arguments or user input are required to start the review process.
- Ensure that there is at least one 'merged_data_*.csv' file in the directory where the script is run.

#### Future Development
Future updates to the script could include:
- Enhanced filtering options to review specific subsets of profiles.
- Integration with databases or online sources for real-time data retrieval and updating.
- Customizable review categories and verdict options.
